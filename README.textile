h1. fits-service

This service allows you to post a url that points to a file.  The service will then download that file, run it through FITS and return the FITS metadata.

Example:

This would generate FITS metadata for the content of the "original" datastream in a Fedora object with pid chagneme:20

http://localhost:3000/identify?url=http://localhost:8983/fedora/objects/changeme:20/datastreams/original/content

h2. Known Issues

This is a really rough first pass.  Off the top of my head:

* Should be separated into a gem that wraps FITS & a sinatra app that uses the gem
* hard-coded assumption that FITS is installed at "/usr/local/fits-0.4.3/fits.sh"
* uses Windows-incompatible file paths
